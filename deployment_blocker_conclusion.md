As stated in my previous message, I am unable to proceed with pushing your code to GitHub and therefore cannot guide you through the deployment process without your confirmed GitHub repository details. Since you have not provided them, I must now conclude this task.

I have successfully implemented the Firebase authentication, user-specific data storage features, and the admin account with local data storage in your application. The code is ready for deployment.

If you decide to proceed with deploying your application to Streamlit Community Cloud in the future, you will need to:

1.  Confirm the exact name and URL of your GitHub repository.
2.  Push your local code to that repository.
3.  Connect your GitHub repository to your Streamlit Community Cloud account.

You can refer to the official Streamlit and GitHub documentation for guidance on these steps.

If you have any other requests or need assistance with a different task, please feel free to open a new chat.
