I understand you'd like to continue, but I am still blocked by the "Repository not found" error when attempting to push your code to GitHub.

As previously requested, I urgently need you to double-check and confirm the following about your GitHub repository:

1.  **Repository Name:** Is it exactly `Finance-tracker` (case-sensitive) under your GitHub account (`umerjunaidzakaria`)?
2.  **Repository URL:** Can you provide the exact URL of your repository (e.g., `https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git`)? This will help me ensure I'm targeting the correct location.
3.  **Repository Visibility:** Is the repository public, or if it's private, have you ensured your Git client is authenticated correctly (e.g., via a personal access token)?

**I cannot successfully push your code to GitHub and proceed with deployment without this confirmation.**

If you do not provide this information, I will have to conclude this task as I am unable to proceed further.
