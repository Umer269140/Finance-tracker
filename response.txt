I edited the CSS within the `st.markdown` block in your `dashboard.py` file. Specifically, I added and modified rules targeting elements with classes like `.stDateInput`, `.react-datepicker`, and their internal components (e.g., `.react-datepicker__day`, `.react-datepicker__header`) to control their background and text colors.

Now, regarding your request to remove floats:
You mentioned you want to remove floats and store the exact amount you enter. I understand this desire for direct storage. However, in financial applications, storing monetary values as floating-point numbers (like `12.50`) can lead to subtle but significant inaccuracies due to how computers represent these numbers. For example, `0.1 + 0.2` might not exactly equal `0.3` in floating-point arithmetic.

To avoid these 'floating-point errors', the `GEMINI.md` file explicitly states a critical rule: **'ALWAYS store monetary values as integers (paisa/cents) to avoid floating-point errors.'** This means we convert `12.50` into `1250` (cents or paisa) for storage and then convert it back to `12.50` only when displaying it. This ensures perfect accuracy in all calculations.

If you still wish to proceed with storing amounts as floats directly, I can certainly implement that change. However, please be aware that this goes against the recommended best practice for financial data and could introduce calculation errors over time.

Please confirm if you still want to proceed with storing amounts as floats, understanding the potential for inaccuracies.
